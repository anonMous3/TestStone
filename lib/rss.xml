like are you just mad that i made fun of destiny? chat is that even more pathetic?
also my friend, A REAL LIVE PALESTINIAN, who i have housed and talked with for 7 years now, has been explaining to me this issue from his real perspective since and continues to do so and i take that more seriously than some cuck who debates for a living, that’s why i don’t talk about it, because it requires so much more understanding and context than i am willing to explain on our comedy podcast, but ill take a cheap shot at someone i hate any day
